--- Challenge 1
#You need to use SQL built-in functions to gain insights relating to
# the duration of movies:
# 1.1 Determine the shortest and longest movie durations 
# and name the values as max_duration and min_duration.

SELECT 
    MAX(length) AS max_duration,
    MIN(length) AS min_duration
FROM film;

# 1.2. Express the average movie duration in hours and minutes. 
# Don't use decimals.
# Hint: Look for floor and round functions.

SELECT 
    FLOOR(AVG(length) / 60) AS avg_hours,
    ROUND(AVG(length) % 60) AS avg_minutes
FROM film;

# You need to gain insights related to rental dates:

# 2.1 Calculate the number of days that the company has been operating.
# Hint: To do this, use the rental table, and the DATEDIFF() 
# function to subtract the earliest date in the rental_date 
# column from the latest date.

SELECT 
    DATEDIFF(MAX(rental_date), MIN(rental_date)) AS operating_days
FROM rental;

# 2.2 Retrieve rental information and add two additional 
# columns to show the month and weekday of the rental. Return 20 rows of results.
SELECT 
    rental_id,
    rental_date,
    MONTH(rental_date) AS rental_month,
    DAYNAME(rental_date) AS rental_weekday
FROM rental
LIMIT 20;

# 2.3 Bonus: Retrieve rental information and add an additional 
# column called DAY_TYPE with values 'weekend' or 'workday', depending on the day of the week.
# Hint: use a conditional expression.

SELECT 
    rental_id,
    rental_date,
    MONTH(rental_date) AS rental_month,
    DAYNAME(rental_date) AS rental_weekday
FROM rental
LIMIT 30;

# You need to ensure that customers can easily access information about the movie collection. 
# To achieve this, retrieve the film titles and their rental duration. If any rental duration value is NULL, 
# replace it with the string 'Not Available'. Sort the results of the film title in ascending order.

# Please note that even if there are currently no null values in the rental duration column,
# the query should still be written to handle such cases in the future.
# Hint: Look for the IFNULL() function.

# Challenge 2
# Next, you need to analyze the films in the collection to gain some more insights. Using the film table, determine:
# 1.1 The total number of films that have been released.

SELECT 
    COUNT(*) AS total_films
FROM film;

# 1.2 The number of films for each rating.
SELECT 
    rating,
    COUNT(*) AS total_films
FROM film
GROUP BY rating;

# 1.3 The number of films for each rating, sorting the results in descending order of the number of films. 
# This will help you to better understand the popularity of different film ratings and adjust purchasing decisions accordingly.
# Using the film table, determine:
# 2.1 The mean film duration for each rating, and sort the results in descending order of the mean duration. 

SELECT 
    rating,
    ROUND(AVG(length), 2) AS avg_duration
FROM film
GROUP BY rating
ORDER BY avg_duration DESC;

# Round off the average lengths to two decimal places. This will help identify popular movie lengths for each category.
# 2.2 Identify which ratings have a mean duration of over two hours in order to help select films for customers who prefer longer movies.
# Bonus: determine which last names are not repeated in the table actor.

SELECT 
    rating,
    ROUND(AVG(length), 2) AS avg_duration
FROM film
GROUP BY rating
HAVING AVG(length) > 120;

SELECT 
    last_name 
FROM actor
GROUP BY last_name
HAVING COUNT(*) = 1;
